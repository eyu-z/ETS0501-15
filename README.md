# startswithmethod

The startswith() method is a string method that checks if a string begins with a specified prefix. It returns True if the string starts with the prefix, and False otherwise.

string: The string you want to check.
prefix: The prefix you're looking for. This can be a string or a tuple of strings.
start (optional): The starting position within the string where the search begins.
end (optional): The ending position within the string where the search ends.

It's frequently used to filter data based on specific prefixes. For example, you might filter a list of filenames to find those that start with "report_" or "image_".
It simplifies the process of parsing strings by allowing you to quickly check for specific starting patterns.
It becomes very useful in conditional statements. For example, you may want to execute a section of code only if a string begins with certian characters.

# endswithmethod

The endswith() method is a string method that checks if a string ends with a specified suffix. It returns True if the string ends with the suffix, and False otherwise.

string: The string you want to check.
suffix: The suffix you're looking for. This can be a string or a tuple of strings.
start (optional): The starting position within the string where the search begins.
end (optional): The ending position within the string where the search ends.

A very common use case is to determine the type of a file based on its extension.
You can use endswith() to validate data formats.
When parsing text data, endswith() can help identify specific patterns at the end of lines or strings. This is useful for analyzing log files, configuration files, or other text-based data.

# countmethod

The count() method returns the number of occurrences of a specified substring within a string.

substring: (Required) The substring you want to count.
start: (Optional) The index where the search begins. The default is 0.
end: (Optional) The index where the search ends. The default is the end of the string.
The count() method returns an integer representing the number of times the substring appears.

Case-sensitive: The count() method is case-sensitive. "A" and "a" are considered different.
It counts non-overlapping occurences.
It's versatile for string analysis.

# replacemethod

The replace() method is a fundamental string manipulation tool found in many programming languages, including Python and Java. Its primary function is to substitute occurrences of a specified substring within a string with another substring.
The replace() method creates a new string where designated parts of the original string are replaced.
It does not modify the original string itself; strings are typically immutable.
old: The substring to be replaced.
new: The substring to replace old with.
count (optional): The maximum number of replacements to make.

The replace() method is generally case-sensitive. "Hello" and "hello" are treated as distinct substrings.
The method returns a new string with the replacements applied.
